In the realm of digital product design, collaboration with stakeholders is key to exploring concepts, iterating, and addressing issues at the start of a project.

The Minimum Viable Deliverable serves as a guide to kickstart the define and discovery phase, leading to concrete design outcomes.

When embarking on a new concept, questions arise: What are we focusing on? What's the project's context? And how can I contribute? Often, it falls upon product designers to deliver tangible outcomes, which forms the crux of this discussion.

Projects typically kick off with a problem statement, whether it's identifying areas for improvement or addressing aesthetic concerns. Each project has its own timeline, priority, and business objectives. As product designers, we often engage in early defining and discovery phases1 to ensure alignment on deliverables and gain the necessary context to address the problem effectively.

Designers can drive value in project kick-offs by focusing on efficiency and minimising uncertainty. Drawing inspiration from Steve Blank and Eric Ries's Minimum Viable Product (MVP)2 concept, which advocates crafting a product version with enough features for early customer use, I've developed a mindset that aligns with this approach. This nimble mindset, combined with reflective queries, can rapidly advance projects from ideation to execution.

Before delving into the importance of project kick-offs, let's address potential challenges that arise early on. When eager to refine early ideas, it's common to lack sufficient details, direction, or concrete designs. Uncertainty may lead you to hesitate to share your work with key stakeholders. However, what if, upon sharing, these stakeholders express confusion? Doubt about your grasp of the project's value proposition can heighten anxiety about its direction. Issues such as unclear design direction, scope expansion, or misunderstandings in communication can compound the challenge.

The term 'minimal' doesn't imply delivering less work, but rather it's about limiting indecision. Aim to minimise time and resources. Make use of wireframing tools like Balsamiq3 or Whimsical4, or simply grab pen and paper to visualise ideas with lower fidelity outcomes. Save your energy and imagination for ideating on the problem statement.

The second phase is viability, focusing on successful execution. Your goal is to understand what success means for your project, involving stakeholders along the way. Projects often start as abstract concepts or problems requiring deep exploration for solutions to evolve from problem statements. Collect every artefact, conversation, insight, and project brief to fuel your ideation. Try exercises like Crazy 8s5, which prompt you to sketch eight ideas in eight minutes, leveraging constraints to explore within known boundaries and achieve desired outcomes.

Being a reliable contributor is key in any company. However, many designers lose focus on their deliverables. The best product designer often shares their work early and frequently. Sharing and delivering are closely linked; new features are shared with peers and stakeholders well before they're finalised. Cultivate the habit of sharing to refine deliverables towards shipment. The refinement phases between sharing and finalising are crucial stages of progress. Similar to a snowball gaining momentum, they are energising for both exploration and execution. I've found progress can be a crucial competency for a problem-oriented designer, where turning complex or fuzzy ideas into viable solutions involves iteration and refinement.

To summarise, use minimum viable deliverable is to avoid overwhelming yourself with the pursuit of perfection. Instead, allocate focused time to address the problem at hand and actively seek feedback to make progress.
