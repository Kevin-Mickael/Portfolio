## Introduction

The first product I led design for was Pendo Roadmaps, where I was responsible for redesigning it into the Pendo ecosystem while simultaneously our engineering team replatformed. One key feature I helped design was the Now, Next, Later Roadmap—an approach aimed at driving strategic planning rather than our existing timeline templates. This roadmap tool, offered as a free resource, allowed users to plan releases, leverage feedback and streamline product development. Ultimately, Pendo Roadmaps became a powerful planning tool for Product Managers to create, share and track milestones efficiently.

The new roadmap template was the second most requested feature, as users wanted an alternative way to share their roadmaps publicly. I began design explorations working in collaborating closely with research and product. Once launched, roadmaps delivered tangible business impact, contributing to $2.2 million in pipeline revenue.

## Discovery

Users struggled to coordinate specific delivery times due to competing priorities. They needed strategic templates that provided clear visualisation and prioritisation of features and initiatives. Notably, 22% of accounts disabled the timeline header on their roadmap.

Recognising this need, we leveraged Pendo’s Validate Ideas feature to poll users on their preferred roadmap template. The Now-Next-Later (NNL) roadmap emerged as the clear winner, securing 53% of the votes. Additionally, our design partners echoed this preference.

Based on user feedback, we determined that a Kanban-style Now-Next-Later roadmap would be the ideal solution. Since this layout closely resembled Kanban boards, much of the discovery phase focused on ensuring that roadmap items fit seamlessly into a column-based structure, delivering a cohesive and intuitive experience.

## What I delivered

#### **Connecting Feedback to Roadmaps**

The NNL roadmap was designed to be fully compatible with the Timeline roadmap, ensuring a seamless experience across Feedback modules.

One of the key achievements was enabling Voice of Customer (VOC) items, such as Ideas from Feedback, to be directly added to the roadmap. This integration helped close the communication loop within our product discovery flywheel, allowing teams to prioritise user insights and align roadmap decisions with real customer needs.

#### **Enhanced Interactions**

We introduced intuitive interactions that users loved, such as drag-and-drop reordering, inline editing, and seamless item movement. Building on this, we expanded functionality for Timeline roadmaps, enabling:

- Nested items for better hierarchy management
- Grouping features into initiatives for clearer Swimlanes
- Moving entire columns or swimlanes for effortless roadmap adjustments

Each of these interactions underwent thorough exploration and iteration, ensuring consistency and usability across all roadmap templates.

#### **Customisation**

Users valued the ability to edit and tailor roadmaps for internal sharing. While validating the Now, Next, Later framework, many shared examples of custom terminology specific to their release process. To support this, I designed field to rename swimlanes and columns, allowing teams to adapt roadmaps to their unique workflows and language preferences.

## Next steps

- Built & launched two roadmap templates: Timeline Roadmap (existing) and Now, Next, Later (new).
- Unified design patterns to ensure a seamless experience across both templates.
- Introduced goal tracking & reporting for measuring roadmap item delivery.
- Enabled public roadmaps with features like shareable URLs, email compatibility, and integration with the Pendo Resource Center.
- Integrated roadmaps into the Listen stack, positioning them as a key communication tool for sharing product plans and closing the loop on user-submitted ideas.


## Learnings

Despite high adoption, many users requested customisation features, such as the ability to add specific labels to their roadmaps, highlighting a need for greater flexibility in how they structure and present their plans.

Through post-launch research and discovery, I found that users primarily leveraged roadmaps for strategic planning sessions and internal product announcements, rather than public sharing. Usage data showed users were often hesitant to share roadmaps externally, reinforcing the need to prioritise internal team collaboration as the core use case.
