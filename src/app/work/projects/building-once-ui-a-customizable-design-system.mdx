## Overview

This project is a lightweight clone of Zoom, built from scratch to explore the core technologies behind video conferencing apps. It provides real-time peer-to-peer video and audio communication via the browser, supporting multiple participants in a shared room.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Video & Audio**: Utilizes WebRTC to establish direct peer-to-peer media streams.
- **Room-Based Architecture**: Users can join and create unique rooms for private conferencing sessions.
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Implements real-time signaling for session negotiation and room coordination.
- **Dynamic Media Handling**: Supports media stream toggling (mute/unmute video/audio).

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between clients and server using WebSockets.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing WebRTC required a strong understanding of how media negotiation and ICE candidate exchange work. Managing signaling events with Socket.IO was key to ensuring seamless communication between users. Through this project, deepened knowledge of peer-to-peer connections and learned how real-time communication systems operate under the hood.

## Outcome

The app serves as a foundational implementation of a Zoom-like experience with essential features. It's a valuable learning resource for understanding the mechanics of WebRTC and real-time communication, and a strong base for adding features like chat, screen sharing, and authentication in future iterations.
