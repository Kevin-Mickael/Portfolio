## Overview

I successfully developed and designed a comprehensive website for "Whitespot," an eco-friendly hotel located in Ukraine. The website serves as the digital storefront for this sustainable hospitality business, effectively showcasing their unique eco-conscious accommodations and amenities.## Key Features

- **Technical Implementation**: The website was built using the Weblium website builder platform, which provided a solid foundation for creating a professional online presence. The design process involved detailed work in Figma, where minimalist and elegant concepts were developed and refined. The resulting site is fully responsive, ensuring that visitors have a seamless experience whether they access the website from desktop computers, tablets, or mobile devices.
- **Design and Interface**: The aesthetic approach embraces minimalism that authentically reflects the eco-conscious philosophy of the hotel. The design features clean lines and a restrained style that creates an elegant and uncluttered user experience. Navigation throughout the site was carefully planned to be intuitive, allowing visitors to easily find information about accommodations, amenities, and booking options without unnecessary complexity.
- **Marketing Optimization**: The website was comprehensively optimized for search engines to improve its visibility in organic search results. Google Analytics was integrated to provide detailed insights into visitor behavior, page performance, and conversion metrics. To streamline marketing tag implementation and management, Google Tag Manager was configured across the site. Additionally, Facebook Pixel was implemented to enable effective social media advertising, conversion tracking, and audience retargeting capabilities.
